# Ian's Password Generator

For this assignment we created a random password generator. It allows for the user to click a button and then asks a series of questions in order to create a password for them. 

## What I Thought About the Assignment

This assignment was very difficult but I believe I completed it correctly with the help of my tutor!. I understand what each section does and commented the code accordingly. I also added some new styling to the button and updated the text.

## Testing Performed
